## ðŸ’» About:

The application developed is a digital menu for a restaurant known as foodExplorer, where it is necessary to authenticate to enter the application through the login screen.

Food Explorer has two personas: the administrator and the user;

The admin is the person in charge of the restaurant, so they can create, view, and delete a dish at any time. 

The user sees all the registered dishes and, when they click on a dish, they are redirected to a new screen with more detailed information about it.

Both the admin and the user can search for dishes by name.

In this application, the following topics were addressed:

- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## ðŸš€ How to run the project.

This project is divided into two parts:
1. Backend (API) 
2. Frontend 

ðŸ’¡The Backend must be running on your machine in order for the frontend to be re-addressed.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Also, it's good to have an editor to work with the code, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


### ðŸš§ Running the BackEnd (server)

```bash
# Download from the repository
$https://github.com/mewerton/FoodExplorer_BackEnd

# Open your VS CODE and then open the Backend folder to open the project
$ cd FoodExplorer_BackEnd

# In the BackEnd insert a port and a secret in the empty .env file
  AUTH_SECRET=
  PORT=

# Install the necessary dependencies
$ npm install

# Now start the BackEnd server
$ npm run dev

# The server will start at port:3000 - go to <http://localhost:3000>
```


### ðŸ’» Running the FrontEnd

```bash

# Download from the repository
$https://github.com/mewerton/FoodExplorer_FrontEnd

# Open your VS CODE and then open the Frontend folder to open the project
$FoodExplorer_FrontEnd

# Install dependencies with:
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode:
$ npm run dev

# The server will start at port:3000 - go to < http://127.0.0.1:5173/ >

# Admin Login
$ email: admin@gmail.com
$ password: 253647

```

## ðŸ›  Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- React.js

## Deploy the project.
https://listmovies333.netlify.app/

___

This BackEnd was hosted directly in Render.
The Frontend, on the other hand, was hosted directly on Netlify.

___
Note: Because it is hosted on a free service, the BackEnd "hibernates" after 15 minutes of non-use.
<br>
If you're trying to access the site and the BackEnd is unresponsive, just wait as it will be "initializing" the services.
<br>
This step may take up to 1 minute, depending on the load on the Render servers.
